### API
#### Linked List Type
#### list newList (void)

Creates a new Linked List type

```
list myList = newList();
```

#### append (list, value)

Appends the value passed into the function into the specified list which is also passed into the functions.

```
list myList = newList();
append(myList, 42);
```

#### frontInsert (list, value)

Prepends the value passed into the function into the specified list which is also passed into the functions.

```
list myList = newList();
frontInsert(myList, 42);
```

#### showList (list)

Prints out the specified Linked List passed into the function

```
list myList = newList();
append(myList, 1);
append(myList, 2);
showList(myList);
// Expected output of above statement: 
// 1
// 2
```

#### int numItems (list l)

Shows the number of items which are in a list

```
list myList = newList();
append(myList, 10);
append(myList, 1);
append(myList, 11);
int numOfItems = numItems(myList);
printf("numOfItems is equivalent to %d\n", numOfItems);
```

#### int lookup (list l, int position)

Shows the value of a node at a given index of a linked list

```
list myList = newList();
append(myList, 10);
append(myList, 1);

int secondElementVal = lookup(myList, 2)
printf("The 2nd element in the linked list is equivalent to %d\n",secondElementVal)
```
